The code is based on getting polish notation in post-order. Working with nodes that each save one expression for continuing the operation and throwing an answer. and throw the answer.
</p>

<p style="

The program has three classes: "Polish", "Node", and "List". Each one has its "archive.cpp" and "archive.h". In the <strong>List</strong> class are most methods that interact with the program. The other classes just are a structure for processing neatly.
